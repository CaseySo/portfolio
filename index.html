  <h1>Casey So</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a Data Science major with a Cognitive Science minor at UC San Diego, interested in machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. Through classes and projects, I’ve worked with real-world datasets, built predictive models, and created interactive visualizations to make complex ideas easier to understand. I enjoy combining technical skills with design and using data to explore questions in technology, society, and the environment.
